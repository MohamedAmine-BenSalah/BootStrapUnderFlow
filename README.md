# BootStrapUnderFlow
Since in RBK we are not allowed to use stack over flow because it gives us straigth answers and provides codes wich will not allow us to learn, i tried to creat BootStrapUnderFlow:
A private webSite for RBK students that contains coding questions and answers, the answers can be hints only 
Sharing coding is not allowed.
